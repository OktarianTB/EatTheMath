# EatTheMath
Welcome to my first project on github!

EatTheMath is an exciting game made using the **Unity game engine and C#**. It is my first fully complete game that I have made independently without following any tutorials/course, using just my knowledge and an occasional google search. It is also my first time using git & github. I had a great time creating it!

You can play the game in your web browser on my website [here](https://oktarian.com/wp-content/EatTheMathGame/index.html).

### **How to Play?**
The goal of the game is to get your bubble to 1000 points. But you will have to face other bubbles that either contain a positive integer (in which case you should try and eat it to increase your score) or a negative one (that you should try and avoid as it will bring your score down). The size of your bubble will increase the bigger your score is, making it harder to avoid negative bubbles. If your bubble's score ever goes down under 0, you lose. Sounds easy? Give it a try!
